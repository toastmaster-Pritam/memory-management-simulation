# Memory Management System Simulation

This is a basic website that simulates a memory management system using the best fit, first fit, and worst fit algorithms. The simulation allows users to understand how these algorithms work and their impact on memory allocation.

## Introduction

The Memory Management System Simulation website provides a visual representation of memory allocation using three different algorithms: best fit, first fit, and worst fit. The purpose of this simulation is to help users understand the advantages and disadvantages of each algorithm and their effects on memory utilization and fragmentation.

## Features

- **Algorithm Selection**: Users can choose between three different memory allocation algorithms: best fit, first fit, and worst fit. This allows them to observe the behavior of each algorithm and compare their performance.
- **Memory Visualization**: The simulation provides a graphical representation of the memory blocks and their allocation status. Allocated blocks are displayed in different colors to differentiate them from free blocks.
- **Process Creation**: Users can create processes of varying sizes to simulate memory allocation requests. The simulation will attempt to allocate the requested memory based on the selected algorithm.
- **Memory Release**: Allocated memory blocks can be released to simulate deallocation. This helps users understand how memory fragmentation can occur and how different algorithms handle it.

## Installation

To use the Memory Management System Simulation website locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Open the `front.html` file in your preferred web browser.

No additional dependencies or installations are required. The website uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, which are supported by modern web browsers.

## Usage

Once you have the website open in your web browser, follow these instructions:

1. Select the desired memory allocation algorithm from the options provided (best fit, first fit, or worst fit).
2. Create processes by specifying their size using the input field provided in the prompt and press enter.
3. Observe the memory blocks and their allocation status in the visualization area. Allocated blocks will be displayed in different colors.
4. To deallocate a memory block, click on the allocated block in the visualization area.
5. Repeat steps 2-4 to simulate different memory allocation scenarios and observe the behavior of the selected algorithm.
